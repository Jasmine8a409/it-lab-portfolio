## What I Learned
- I learned that the printer power cable differs from the standard AC cable (ie, HP printers).
- While it may seem simple, the differing cables can still trip someone up if they don't look correctly and verify that the correct cables are there.

## Next Time / Variations
- I will note which cable goes where when I unplug them.
