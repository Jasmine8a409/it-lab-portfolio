## Objectives
* Install and Connect Peripherals
* Establish Power and Network Connections
* Verify System Functionality

---

## Environment / Tools
- **OS / Version:** Windows 10 (Simulated via CompTIA A+ Lab platform)
- **Tools / Commands:** - Virtual Lab Interface
    - On-screen connector identification tools
    - Hardware: Power strip, monitor, printer, keyboard, mouse, speakers
    - Connectivity: Ethernet (RJ-45)
- **Network Topology:** Single workstation connected to a wired LAN via a wall network port. No additional network devices (router/switch) were configured.

---

## Steps (High Level)
1. **Physical Peripheral Connection** Identified and connected input/output devices. Plugged the keyboard and mouse into USB ports, connected the monitor via HDMI/DisplayPort, and attached the speakers to the lime-green 3.5mm TRS audio jack. Ensured the printer was connected via USB.



2. **Network and Power Integration** Connected the RJ-45 Ethernet cable from the computer’s NIC to the wall jack. Plugged all power cables into the surge protector, then toggled the power strip and the PC's rear PSU switch to the **ON** position.

3. **Verification and Post-Setup** Powered on the system and observed the **POST (Power-On Self-Test)**. Logged into Windows 10, verified network connectivity via the taskbar icon, and performed a test print to confirm hardware communication.

## Troubleshooting Notes
- **Symptoms:** Monitor displays "No Signal" despite computer fans spinning and active LEDs.
- **Root Cause:** The video cable was plugged into the motherboard's integrated graphics port instead of the dedicated GPU port.
- **Fix & Validation:** Moved the HDMI cable to the horizontal expansion slot (GPU). The display immediately initialized to the Windows login screen.

## What I Learned
- **Port Identification & Color Coding:** I learned to quickly distinguish between legacy and modern ports, specifically recognizing color-coded audio jacks (lime-green for speakers) and USB 3.0 (blue).
- **Proper Power Sequencing:** I realized the importance of checking the physical I/O switch on the Power Supply Unit (PSU) as a primary troubleshooting step.

## Next Time / Variations
- **Wireless Configuration:** I plan to practice this setup using a Wi-Fi configuration and Bluetooth peripherals to understand driver installation differences compared to plug-and-play wired devices.
