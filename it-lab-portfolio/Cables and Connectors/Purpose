This lab showcases my ability to install, configure, and support personal computer (PC) hardware — one of the core responsibilities of a CompTIA A+ technician. It demonstrates hands-on proficiency with how internal components and external devices connect and communicate through the motherboard.

Specifically, this lab highlights my ability to:

Identify and explain cable types and connectors, including modern standards like USB, HDMI, and DisplayPort, as well as legacy connectors such as VGA, IDE, and PS/2.

Install and configure motherboards, including setting up the chipset, configuring the BIOS/UEFI, installing the CPU and RAM, and placing the expansion card.

Recognize and support legacy hardware, ensuring compatibility and troubleshooting across older systems.

Assemble and verify complete PC builds, confirming that all components and peripherals function properly.

Select appropriate hardware configurations and peripherals to meet user or business needs.

Through this project, I’m showcasing the hands-on skills required for CompTIA A+ Core 1 (220-1101) certification and demonstrating readiness for real-world IT support and hardware technician roles.
