# Jasmine Burns ‚Äî IT Lab Portfolio

This repository documents my hands‚Äëon practice across TestOut LabSim, CompTIA CertMaster Labs, Packet Tracer, and home labs.
I record each lab with a short write‚Äëup, screenshots, and (when allowed) a YouTube walkthrough.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Respecting platform ToS**: I never upload proprietary course content (prompts, PDFs, lab text, or UI screens that reveal paid material). Videos focus on *my* workflow, terminal, and results.
